B.system call
This repository also contains an implementation of the mprotect() system call in Gentoo Linux. It demonstrates memory protection manipulation using a C program that allocates memory, sets protection flags (such as PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, PROT_NONE), modifies access rights with mprotect(), and handles segmentation faults gracefully. Key features include fine-grained control over memory regions, secure handling of dynamic memory, and practical use cases in debugging and sandboxing applications.
